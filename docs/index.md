<p>
The <a href="https://github.com/pdf-association/pdf-issues/">public GitHub repository "pdf-issues"</a> hosted by the <a href="https://www.pdfa.org">PDF Association</a>
provides all developers a means of openly reporting issues against any published PDF 2.0 related standard for review and resolution by industry and ISO experts.
All issues in PDF specifications are important, from minor typos and formatting issues, to
larger ambiguous, unclear or apparently contradictory statements. By reaching consensus on resolutions as an industry,
PDF interoperability and implementation reliability will be improved.
</p>

<p>Resolutions to issues in the following ISO publications are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li>PDF 2.0 [<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html" target="_blank">ISO 32000-2:2020</a>]</li>
<li>PDF/A-4 [<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71832.html" target="_blank">ISO 19005-4:2020</a>]</li>
<li>PDF/X-6 [<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/77103.html" target="_blank">ISO 15930-9:2020</a>]</li>
<li>PDF/VT-3 [<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/75218.html" target="_blank">ISO 16612-3:2020</a>]</li>
<li>ECMAScript for PDF 2.0 [<a href="https://www.iso.org/standard/71559.html" target="_blank">ISO 21757-1:2020</a>]</li>
</ul>

(ISO TC 171 SC 2 and ISO TC 130 WG 2), and may be changed in future ISO publications. A complete list of all
<a href="https://www.pdfa.org/iso-status/" target="_parent">current work in progress of each PDF-related ISO working group</a> is also maintained by the PDF Association.
