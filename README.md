This public repository is hosted by the [PDF Association](https://www.pdfa.org) in order to provide developers with a means of openly reporting issues against the latest core PDF 2.0 specification ([ISO 32000-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html)) for review and resolution by industry and ISO experts. All issues in the PDF specification are important, from minor typos and formatting issues, to larger ambiguous, unclear or apparently contradictory statements. By reaching consensus on resolutions as an industry, PDF interoperability and implementation reliability will be improved.

Resolutions proposed here are **not** officially authorized by the ISO working group responsible for PDF (ISO TC 171 SC 2 WG 8) and may be changed in future ISO 32000 publications.

## A Simple Process
1. Open a new GitHub Issue using one of the provided templates. Clearly explain the mistake you have found in ISO 32000-2:2020 or the feature you would like to see in a future version of PDF.
2. The community can discuss and contribute to open issues here in GitHub.
3. The PDF Association's [PDF Technical Working Group](https://www.pdfa.org/community/pdf-technical-working-group/) (TWG) will consider all input and reach a consensus for resolution.
4. The issue will be updated with the agreed resolution and Closed by moderators.

A full list of all issue resolutions is published at https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/.
