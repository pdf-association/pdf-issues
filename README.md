This public repository is hosted by the [PDF Association](https://www.pdfa.org) to provide developers with a means of openly reporting issues against any of the latest published PDF 2.0-based ISO standards for review and resolution by industry experts. All issues in PDF specifications are important, from minor typos and formatting issues, to larger ambiguous, unclear or apparently contradictory statements. By reaching consensus on resolutions as an industry, PDF interoperability and implementation reliability will be improved. This repo supports issues logged against all published PDF 2.0-based ISO standards:

* PDF 2.0 ([ISO 32000-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html))
* PDF/A-4 ([ISO 19005-4:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/71832.html))
* PDF/X-6 ([ISO 15930-9:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/77103.html))
* PDF/VT-3 ([ISO 16612-3:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75218.html))
* ECMAScript for PDF 2.0 ([ISO 21757-1:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/71559.html))

Resolutions proposed here are **not** officially authorized by the [ISO working groups responsible for PDF](https://www.pdfa.org/iso-status/) and may get changed by future ISO publications.

## A Simple Process
1. Open a new GitHub Issue. Clearly explain the mistake you have found in a published ISO PDF 2.0-based standard, or the feature you would like to see in a future version.
2. The community can discuss and contribute to open issues here in GitHub, and work towards a proposed resolution.
3. The PDF Association's [PDF Technical Working Group](https://www.pdfa.org/community/pdf-technical-working-group/) (TWG) will consider all input and reach a consensus for each proposed resolution. Issues related to PDF subset standards may also get passed on to other TWGs.
4. Each issue will be updated with the agreed resolution and then Closed by moderators once the resolution is published at [https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/](https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/).

A full list of all industry-agreed issue resolutions (as pseudo-markup) is actively maintained at [https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/](https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/).

## Directly referencing resolutions

Errata can always be referred by the appropriate GitHub issue numbers(s). Resolutions are published to a set of static URLs at [https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/](https://www.pdfa.org/pdf-issues/) of the form `<standard-number>/clause<clause-number>.html`. Each of these resolution pages also includes anchor pointss for all Headings (`Hx.y.z` anchors to heading X.Y.Z in the appropriate ISO standard) and Tables (`TableXXX` anchors to Table XXX in the appropriate ISO standard. This allows very precise linkages to the final resolution outcomes, without scrolling through long GitHub discussions.

For example:

- [https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clauseAnnexQ.html](https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clauseAnnexQ.html) links directly to all resolutions in Annex Q *(normative) Method for determining transparency on a page* of ISO 32000-2:2020 (PDF 2.0).
- [https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clause12.html#H12.5.6.5](https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clause12.html#H12.5.6.5) links directly to all resolutions in ISO 32000-2:2020 (PDF 2.0) clause 12.5.6.5 *Link annotations*.
- [https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clause08.html#Table87](https://pdfa.org/pdf-issues/32000-2-2020/clause08.html#Table87) links directly to all resolutions in ISO 32000-2:2020 (PDF 2.0) Table 87 - *Additional entries specific to an image dictionary*.
