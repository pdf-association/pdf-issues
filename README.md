# pdf-issues

This public repository is hosted by the [PDF Association](https://www.pdfa.org) for openly reporting issues against the latest core PDF 2.0 specification ([ISO 32000-2:2020](https://www.iso.org/standard/75839.html)) and having industry and ISO experts expeditously propose and agree resolutions. All issues in the PDF specification are important, from minor typos and formatting issues, to larger ambiguous, unclear or apparently contradictory statements. By reaching consensus on resolutions as an industry, PDF interoperability and implementation reliability will be improved.  

Resolutions proposed here are **not** officially authorized by ISO and may be changed in future ISO 32000 publications.
